# There's nothing here! That's because this file's name is stupid, and vim can't tell this
# configuration file format is basically YAML. That's why I'm going to be putting all of the
# config in the drop-in folder (dunstrc.d), where dunst will actually look for files that end in
# `.conf`. This is still not YAML, but at least I get some syntax highlighting when I open them.
