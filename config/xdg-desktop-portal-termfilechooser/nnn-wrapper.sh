# nnn has no equivalent of ranger's:
# `--cmd`
# .. and no other way to show a message text on startup. So, no way to show instructions in nnn itself, like it is done in ranger-wrapper.
# nnn also does not show previews (needs a plugin and a keypress). So, the save instructions in `$path` file are not shown automatically.
# `--show-only-dirs`
# `--choosedir`
# Navigating to a dir and quitting nnn would not write it to the selection file. To select a dir, use <Space> on a dir name, then quit nnn.
# Although perhaps it could be scripted together with https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Basic-use-cases#configure-cd-on-quit
# This missing functionality probably could be implemented with a plugin.
