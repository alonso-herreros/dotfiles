# This wrapper script is invoked by xdg-desktop-portal-termfilechooser.
#
# Inputs:
# 1. "1" if multiple files can be chosen, "0" otherwise.
# 2. "1" if a directory should be chosen, "0" otherwise.
# 3. "0" if opening files was requested, "1" if writing to a file was
#    requested. For example, when uploading files in Firefox, this will be "0".
#    When saving a web page in Firefox, this will be "1".
# 4. If writing to a file, this is recommended path provided by the caller. For
#    example, when saving a web page in Firefox, this will be the recommended
#    path Firefox provided, such as "~/Downloads/webpage_title.html".
#    Note that if the path already exists, we keep appending "_" to it until we
#    get a path that does not exist.
# 5. The output path, to which results should be written.
#
# Output:
# The script should print the selected paths to the output path (argument #5),
# one path per line.
# If nothing is printed, then the operation is assumed to have been canceled.
